# CarManagementSystem
This is an ASP.NET project that utilizes the MVC design pattern to create a car management system for a car dealership to keep track of the cars they currently have in stock.
This project works with a database following CRUD operators and displays the updates back to the user. 
The project runs in the .NET core environment and runs on an IIS server provided by the framework. 
Some features to be implemented soon in the future: 
- Search functionality to find specific car brands and models
- Customer MVC to keep track of any cars the customer buys along with their information
- Pictures for each of the car to better display the car's features
- Cleaner and more vibrant front-end design for the website
